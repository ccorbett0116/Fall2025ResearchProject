    "## Description:\n",
    "The deployment of medical AI systems across different hospitals raises critical questions about whether fairness and representation quality can be reliably transferred across clinical domains. Models trained on one hospital’s imaging data are often reused in new environments where patient demographics, imaging devices, and diagnostic practices differ substantially, potentially resulting in unintended bias against certain groups. This project investigates this challenge by studying fairness-aware representation alignment in medical imaging. The student will train contrastive learning models—such as SimCLR—independently on two large-scale chest X-ray datasets: CheXpert (from Stanford Hospital) and MIMIC-CXR (from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center). After learning embeddings in each domain, the student will apply domain alignment techniques such as Procrustes alignment to map representations from the CheXpert embedding space into the MIMIC-CXR space. The aligned embeddings will then be evaluated using fairness metrics designed for representation spaces, including demographic subgroup alignment, intra- vs. inter-group embedding disparity, and cluster-level demographic parity. The expected outcome is a rigorous understanding of whether fairness properties learned in one hospital setting preserve, degrade, or improve when transferred to another, revealing how robust model fairness is to realworld clinical domain shifts. A practical use case involves a healthcare network seeking to deploy a model trained at a major academic hospital (e.g., Stanford) into a community hospital setting: this project helps determine whether the transferred representations remain equitable across patient groups such as older adults, women, or specific disease cohorts. The findings will support responsible AI deployment in healthcare by highlighting the conditions under which fairness is stable across institutions and identifying scenarios where domain-specific mitigation strategies may be required."

    "\n",
    "This cell performs **Procrustes alignment** to map CheXpert embeddings into MIMIC-CXR embedding space by finding an optimal rotation matrix. The two SimCLR models learned different \"coordinate systems\" for their embeddings, and Procrustes rotates one to match the other while preserving distances. We use the **stratified approach** because it samples equally from each disease category, ensuring that the alignment is guided by semantically matched pairs rather than random pairings. This creates a more accurate rotation matrix since we're explicitly teaching it that \"pneumonia in CheXpert space should map to pneumonia in MIMIC space\" for all 10 diseases, rather than hoping random samples happen to align well."

    "| **t-SNE / UMAP** | Visual clustering of embeddings in 2D | Helps us see if images with similar features (or disease labels) naturally group together | Clusters should form for similar disease cases; overlapping clusters indicate embeddings are less discriminative |\n",
    "| **Silhouette Score** | How well each point fits within its cluster | Quantifies clustering quality numerically | Score ranges from -1 to 1; closer to 1 = tight, well-separated clusters; negative = poor separation |\n",
    "| **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** | Classification accuracy using nearest neighbors in embedding space | Tests whether embeddings capture disease information that can predict labels | High accuracy (>70%) shows embeddings encode meaningful disease patterns; low accuracy suggests weak embeddings |\n",
    "| **Cross-Dataset KNN** | KNN accuracy when training on one dataset and testing on another | Measures generalization of embeddings across datasets | High accuracy indicates good transferability; low accuracy indicates dataset-specific features dominate |\n",
    "| **AUROC (Area Under ROC Curve)** | Ability of embeddings to rank positive vs. negative cases | Standard for binary classification performance; insensitive to class imbalance | Values range 0–1; 0.5 = random, >0.7 is reasonable, >0.9 is excellent. AUROC near 0.5 for cross-dataset means poor generalization |\n",
    "| **PCA Explained Variance** | How much of the embedding variance is captured by the principal components | Helps identify dominant patterns in the embeddings and dimensionality reduction | Usually first 2–3 PCs capture meaningful variance; low variance explained may suggest complex or noisy embeddings |\n"
